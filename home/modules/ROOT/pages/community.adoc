These channels serve as hubs for sharing ideas, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating development efforts.

One of the defining characteristics of the Jetty community is its inclusivity. Whether you're a seasoned Java developer or a newcomer eager to learn, there's a place for you in the Jetty community. Beginners are welcomed with open arms, encouraged to ask questions, and guided by experienced members who are passionate about nurturing the next generation of contributors.
